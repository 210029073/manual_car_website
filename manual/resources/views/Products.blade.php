    In order to re-use blade files use @extends('page')
    This will simply make use of the page page's style and html structure
    And you can merge you own content for the page, whilst maintaining the same structure
    of the page.

    It will make sense to make use of these features when you wish to apply the SAME
    housestyle for each page.

    Avoid DRY code at all times.
